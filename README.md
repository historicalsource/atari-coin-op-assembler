This repository contains:

* centipede/ A copy of the Centipede source code from the HistoricalSource repo.
* centipede-reassembled/ a copy of the reassembled centipede revision.v2 with this assembler, some discrepancies here.
* atari_tools/ The Atari coin-op tools for a PDP-11 system running RT-11

I have placed the read-me for each piece inside each directory.
